            <p class="p-section1">
                Hi my name is Jonel Tapia. I am new in this field and I've been trying to explore some things here, and
                I
                found it quite interesting so that's why I go learn some stuff that I'm interested in. Web development
                is
                fun though but I enjoy Java development much more than it. I am very passionate about what I'm doing and
                i
                dont settle less in learning, My goal is to become the better version of myself and one day be a
                Software
                Developer.
            </p>

        <div class="about-2">
            <h2> Why did I take this path? </h2>
            <p class="p-section1">
                I like to create small projects even though it seems useless to others but as an aspiring developer
                constructing and learning new things every day is so satisfying. And I'm that person who likes to take
                on challenges so that's why I decided to take this path. And to be honest, learning to code every day is
                very addictive it feels that you just want to sit in the front of a computer for a long long time, I
                know it's hard but once you get hang of it, learning software development is fun.
            </p>

    </div>

    <section class="about-3">
        <h2> Goal </h2>
        <p>My Goal is not different from others. It's simple to be an expert in this field. Someday I want to lead a
            software development project and publish my own article. </p>
    </section>

    <div class="about-4">
        <section class="strength">
            <h2> My Strength </h2>
            <p>I know that i procrastinate a lot but i have this so called "power" that i have the ability to learn
                fast and to adopt on something. I have this curiosity feeling that when im learning on something new or
                something that is not yet familiar for me, i feel very happy its like i love learning so much that i
                have this positive attitude flowing inside me.</p>

            <h2> My Weakness </h2>
            <p>My weakness is that I have this so-called procrastination and because of this I can not finish the task
                in the given time frame. I don't know even though the task is not that hard, sometimes when I hit the
                wall I procrastinate a lot. And I'm very shy to approach someone to ask for some help because I kept
                thinking that "what if they ignore my question" and because of that it's hard for me to talk to someone.
                But I'm trying my best to ask some questions even though sometimes they disregard my question.</p>
